# embersiteguide
My working through code from the emberjs.com site guides/tutorials.

## Day 1

* Install `node`. X
* Install `git`. X
* Install `watchman` https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html X (with python,
with pcre)  Had to also install python-dev
* install ember-cli (globally, with `npm`) (this took a really long time; I quit and
started again and it was faster <?>)
    * Removed everything under ~/node_modules and re-installed AS ROOT with `-g`
* install phantomjs2
* (created ~/.npmrc, with `loglevel="verbose"` so I could see what was going on)
* Install phantomjs2
    * Failed horribly.  Trying from source.
    * Almost worse.  Takes a very long time to compile.  S'ok, I got a little time.
    * 1.9 is in apt-get...
    * There are some pre-built 2.x binaries here: https://github.com/bprodoehl/phantomjs/releases

* First app with `ember new my-new-app`. This is an enormous amount of code, tagging here
  with "first-app".
